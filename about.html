                Before and during school, I have spent my career devolping my team / leadership skills. 
                From 2020-2025, I've helped manage 500,000ft<sup>2</sup> of distribution space and lead a team of over 100 members. 
                Before logistics, I've worked in a multitude of customer-facing jobs, developing my ability to assist with needs and complaints of consumers.

                At home, I'm married and the father of three kids, two sons and one daughter. 
                As far as I'm concerned, they're the sweetest and smartest kids around.
                In the rare personal free time I get, I enjoy playing games, particularly earning <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/gamer/RedAtaxia" target="_blank">achievements.</a>
